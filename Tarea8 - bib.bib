abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used to study complex environmental phenomena with high variability in time and space. In this study, the potential of exploiting three categories of ML regression models, including classical regression, shallow learning and deep learning for predicting soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from an agricultural field was explored. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, as well as various environmental, agronomic and soil data were measured at the site over a five-year period in Quebec, Canada. The rigorous analysis, which included statistical comparison and cross-validation for the prediction of CO2 and N2O fluxes, confirmed that the LSTM model performed the best among the considered ML models with the highest R coefficient and the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) values (R = 0.87 and RMSE = 30.3 mg·m−2·hr−1 for CO2 flux prediction and R = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.19 mg·m−2·hr−1 for N2O flux prediction). The predictive performances of LSTM were more accurate than those simulated in a previous study conducted by a biophysical-based Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2). The classical regression models (namely RF, SVM and LASSO) satisfactorily simulated cyclical and seasonal variations of CO2 fluxes (R = 0.75, 0.71 and 0.68, respectively); however, they failed to reasonably predict the peak values of N2O fluxes (R < 0.25). Shallow ML was found to be less effective in predicting GHG fluxes than other considered ML models (R < 0.7 for CO2 flux and R < 0.3 for estimating N2O fluxes) and was the most sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Based on this comprehensive comparison study, it was elicited that the LSTM model can be employed successfully in simulating GHG emissions from agricultural soils, providing a new perspective on the application of machine learning modeling for predicting GHG emissions to the environment.}

abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions are a global problem. Although the EU countries from 1990 to 2012 reduced their total emissions by 19.2% (CO2 eq.), it is still necessary to limit their emissions. In the article the possibility of using the taxonomic methods that allow grouping (classifying) objects described by many attributes (variables) is presented. In particular, cluster analysis was used, in which some methods for the isolation of homogeneous subsets of surveyed objects can be distinguished. One of such method is k-means algorithm. As a measure of similarity of objects in clusters the Euclidean distance was applied. In the analysis 28 European countries were taken as objects of research and they were described by four attributes (variables), i.e. the emission levels of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and nitrous oxide. The aim of the analysis is to grouping objects – the European countries – into clusters that are most similar to each other in the same cluster and most unlike in other clusters. The research was carried out according to total greenhouse gas emissions, and according to emissions of these gases per capita of the countries surveyed. The analyses are based on Eurostat reports.}

abstract = {Quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from irrigated paddy fields is of great significance for addressing climate change. Machine learning (ML) provides an alternative to empirical models and biogeochemical models, but it has not been used to simulate GHG emissions from paddy fields. In this study, a three-year field experiment dataset of paddy fields under controlled irrigation (CI, a kind of water-saving irrigation (WSI) technology) and flood irrigation (FI) in Kunshan, China, was collected, as well as a global dataset on WSI and FI. Then, the stacking ensemble model was developed based on three basic ML models, random forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor regression (KNN), gradient boosting regression (GBR), and a meta-learner, linear Regression (LR). Those models were used for the first time to simulate CH4 and N2O emissions on different time scales from paddy fields under WSI and FI. The results showed that the cumulative CH4 and N2O emissions from the WSI paddy fields decreased by 61.14% and increased by 19.52%, respectively, compared with FI. The ML algorithm can be applied to simulate daily, growth stages, and cumulative GHG emissions from paddy fields, but the performance of the linear regression model was worse than other ML models. Compared with the basic models, the stacking model improved the accuracy, improving the R2 by 0.37∼13.36% and reducing the RMSE by 3.23∼42.78%. Soil redox, temperature, and moisture are necessary for accurate modeling. Meanwhile, training the model using data from WSI and FI separately is beneficial to improve the accuracy of the model. The availability of the stacking model in other stations was verified based on literature data, with R2 varying between 0.7634 and 0.9985. Therefore, the stacking model is recommended to predict GHG emissions at different time scales from paddy fields, and this method can be extended to estimate GHG from paddy fields at various stations around the world.}

ABSTRACT = {A reliable quantification of greenhouse gas emissions is a basis for the development of adequate mitigation measures. Protocols for emission measurements and data analysis approaches to extrapolate to accurate annual emission values are a substantial prerequisite in this context. We systematically analyzed the benefit of supervised machine learning methods to project methane emissions from a naturally ventilated cattle building with a concrete solid floor and manure scraper located in Northern Germany. We took into account approximately 40 weeks of hourly emission measurements and compared model predictions using eight regression approaches, 27 different sampling scenarios and four measures of model accuracy. Data normalization was applied based on median and quartile range. A correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of individual features. This indicated only a very weak linear relation between the methane emission and features that are typically used to predict methane emission values of naturally ventilated barns. It further highlighted the added value of including day-time and squared ambient temperature as features. The error of the predicted emission values was in general below 10%. The results from Gaussian processes, ordinary multilinear regression and neural networks were least robust. More robust results were obtained with multilinear regression with regularization, support vector machines and particularly the ensemble methods gradient boosting and random forest. The latter had the added value to be rather insensitive against the normalization procedure. In the case of multilinear regression, also the removal of not significantly linearly related variables (i.e., keeping only the day-time component) led to robust modeling results. We concluded that measurement protocols with 7 days and six measurement periods can be considered sufficient to model methane emissions from the dairy barn with solid floor with manure scraper, particularly when periods are distributed over the year with a preference for transition periods. Features should be normalized according to median and quartile range and must be carefully selected depending on the modeling approach.},
