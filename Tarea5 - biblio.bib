abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used to study complex environmental phenomena with high variability in time and space. In this study, the potential of exploiting three categories of ML regression models, including classical regression, shallow learning and deep learning for predicting soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from an agricultural field was explored. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, as well as various environmental, agronomic and soil data were measured at the site over a five-year period in Quebec, Canada. The rigorous analysis, which included statistical comparison and cross-validation for the prediction of CO2 and N2O fluxes, confirmed that the LSTM model performed the best among the considered ML models with the highest R coefficient and the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) values (R = 0.87 and RMSE = 30.3 mg·m−2·hr−1 for CO2 flux prediction and R = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.19 mg·m−2·hr−1 for N2O flux prediction). The predictive performances of LSTM were more accurate than those simulated in a previous study conducted by a biophysical-based Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2). The classical regression models (namely RF, SVM and LASSO) satisfactorily simulated cyclical and seasonal variations of CO2 fluxes (R = 0.75, 0.71 and 0.68, respectively); however, they failed to reasonably predict the peak values of N2O fluxes (R < 0.25). Shallow ML was found to be less effective in predicting GHG fluxes than other considered ML models (R < 0.7 for CO2 flux and R < 0.3 for estimating N2O fluxes) and was the most sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Based on this comprehensive comparison study, it was elicited that the LSTM model can be employed successfully in simulating GHG emissions from agricultural soils, providing a new perspective on the application of machine learning modeling for predicting GHG emissions to the environment.}

abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions are a global problem. Although the EU countries from 1990 to 2012 reduced their total emissions by 19.2% (CO2 eq.), it is still necessary to limit their emissions. In the article the possibility of using the taxonomic methods that allow grouping (classifying) objects described by many attributes (variables) is presented. In particular, cluster analysis was used, in which some methods for the isolation of homogeneous subsets of surveyed objects can be distinguished. One of such method is k-means algorithm. As a measure of similarity of objects in clusters the Euclidean distance was applied. In the analysis 28 European countries were taken as objects of research and they were described by four attributes (variables), i.e. the emission levels of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and nitrous oxide. The aim of the analysis is to grouping objects – the European countries – into clusters that are most similar to each other in the same cluster and most unlike in other clusters. The research was carried out according to total greenhouse gas emissions, and according to emissions of these gases per capita of the countries surveyed. The analyses are based on Eurostat reports.}
